Kubernetes is managed using config files.

Each config file is used to create Objects inside k8s cluster.
    Types of Objects:
        StatefulSet
        ReplicaController
        Pod
        Service

'Kind' keyword in config file defines the type of object we want to make using that config file.

Some objects are used to run container, monitor a container, creating networks.

Service object: helps us to setup networking inside our k8s cluster. 

'apiVersion: v1': Limits types of object we want to create a config with given file.
    This gives us access to the predefined set of objects like.
        componentStatus, configMap, Endpoints, Event, Namespace, Pod

'apiVersion: apps/v1': Limits types of object we want to create a config with given file.
    This gives us access to the predefined set of objects like.
       ControllerRevision, StatefulSet

Pod: Its is a grouping of containers with a very common purpose. This is a smallest object which can be deployed in k8s.
    Containers are always deployed inside a pod.
